4. **Try AI queries**:
   - "This space is empty, suggest furniture"
   - "What colors would work here?"
   - "Make this room more cozy"
5. **Select furniture** - should show AR placement view
6. **Test AR placement** - should launch native AR viewer
7. **Try voice input** - tap microphone for speech input
8. **Test sharing** - should copy link or open share dialog

### Edge Cases Covered âœ…
